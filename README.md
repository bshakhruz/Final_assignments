# My First Repo: Learning C++ 
I started to learn my first programming language, C++, at the beginning of 2022. This repository includes the resources I have found most helpful for learning C++. I will also include the C++ projects I create while I am learning. 
## Resources for Learning C++

I will keep updating this list as I learn more.
